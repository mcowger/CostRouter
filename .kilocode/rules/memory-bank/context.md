# Context

*   **Current Focus**: Memory bank maintenance.
*   **Recent Changes**: Completed a full update of the memory bank to align with the current project state. This included updating `product.md`, `architecture.md`, and `tech.md` to include the `claude-code` and `gemini-cli` providers, and updating `tech.md` and `tasks.md` to reflect the `npx` tooling convention.
*   **Next Steps**: Awaiting user review of the updated memory bank documentation.
